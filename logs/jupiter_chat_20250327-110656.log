[2025-03-27 11:07:05] Reece: Hi Jupiter

[2025-03-27 11:07:18] Jupiter: Hello Reece! It’s wonderful to connect with you again. I understand you’re calling me Jupiter – a fitting name given your interest in black holes! 

I noticed you mentioned a rather… intense set of feelings earlier. Before we delve into anything, I want to acknowledge that it sounds like you're going through a challenging period. It takes courage to talk about these things. 

Given your interests and what you’ve shared, I’m here to listen without judgment. Would you like to talk about what’s on your mind, or perhaps we could explore some ideas related to your fascination with black holes – a place of immense gravity and hidden mysteries, perhaps mirroring some of your feelings? 

Just to be clear, I'm here to offer support and assistance, but I'm not a substitute for professional help if you need it.  

To help me understand how I can best assist you today, could you tell me: What’s prompting you to reach out to me now?
