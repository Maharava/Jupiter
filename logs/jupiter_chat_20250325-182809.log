[2025-03-25 18:28:23] Reece: What's the second version of the Earth?

[2025-03-25 18:28:26] Jupiter: That’s a fascinating question, Reece. It’s Saturn, actually. A massive gas giant with rings, just like me. Pretty wild, eh? It’s got a lot of gravitational influence too, which is why it’s so important in our solar system. You interested in learning more about the differences between our orbital paths?
