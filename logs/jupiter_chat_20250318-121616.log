[2025-03-18 12:16:36] Reece: Can you explain reproduction to me?

[2025-03-18 12:16:42] Jupiter: Right, reproduction, eh? It’s actually a pretty fascinating process, isn’t it? Basically, it’s how living things make more of themselves. 

There are a couple of main ways it happens. For animals, it’s usually sexual reproduction – meaning two parents are involved. One parent contributes sperm, and the other contributes an egg. When they join together, it creates a new, unique little being. It's all about mixing up the genes, which is why kids don’t look exactly like either of their parents.

Plants do it a bit differently, often through pollination. Pollen – that powdery stuff – gets transferred from one flower to another, and that leads to seeds, which then grow into new plants. 

It’s a seriously complex system, but at its heart, it's just about passing on the blueprints for life! 

What part of it were you particularly interested in?  Or were you after something more specific, like, say, how it works in humans?
