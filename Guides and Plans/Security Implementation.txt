# Jupiter Security Enhancement Guide

## Overview

Jupiter currently stores user data in plaintext JSON files, logs conversations without encryption, and lacks robust authentication. This document outlines practical measures to enhance security while maintaining Jupiter's functionality.

## 1. User Data Encryption

### Why It's Needed
User data files (`user_data.json`) contain potentially sensitive information about users' preferences, interests, and personal details in plaintext, which could be exposed if unauthorized access occurs.

### Implementation Approach

#### Option A: File-level Encryption
1. **Setup**
   - Add the `cryptography` library to dependencies
   - Generate and securely store an encryption key

2. **Implementation Sequence**
   - Create an EncryptedStorage class that extends current storage capabilities
   - Modify UserModel and DataManager to use this encrypted storage
   - Implement transparent encryption/decryption when reading/writing user data
   - Add a key management system (consider environment variables or a key file with restricted permissions)

3. **Migration**
   - Create a migration utility to convert existing unencrypted data
   - Implement backward compatibility for reading legacy formats

#### Option B: Field-level Encryption
1. **Setup**
   - Similar library requirements as Option A
   - Define which fields require encryption (e.g., personal information vs. preferences)

2. **Implementation Sequence**
   - Modify the user data schema to mark sensitive fields
   - Implement field-level encryption/decryption in UserModel
   - Maintain unencrypted access to non-sensitive fields for better performance

## 2. Authentication System

### Why It's Needed
Currently, anyone can claim to be any user by simply entering their name, which lacks proper verification.

### Implementation Approach

#### Basic Password Protection
1. **User Registration**
   - Add password fields to user creation
   - Store passwords using strong hashing (bcrypt or Argon2)
   - Implement a proper registration flow

2. **Login Process**
   - Create a secure login screen
   - Implement password verification
   - Generate session tokens for authenticated sessions

3. **Session Management**
   - Add timeout for inactive sessions
   - Implement secure session storage

## 3. Conversation Log Security

### Why It's Needed
Chat logs contain user conversations that might include sensitive information but are currently stored as plaintext.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Log Encryption**
   - Encrypt log files using the same mechanism as user data
   - Implement key management aligned with user data encryption

2. **Sensitive Data Filtering**
   - Add pattern recognition for sensitive data (credit cards, addresses, etc.)
   - Implement automatic redaction in logs
   - Create a configurable sensitivity level

3. **Log Retention Policy**
   - Add configurable log retention periods
   - Implement secure log deletion methods
   - Create log archiving with stronger encryption for older logs

## 4. Input Validation & Sanitization

### Why It's Needed
User inputs could potentially contain malicious content that might affect the application's behavior.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Input Validation**
   - Add validation for all user inputs
   - Implement input length limits
   - Create input format validators for structured data

2. **Command Sanitization**
   - Parse and validate all special commands (e.g., `/name`)
   - Implement proper escaping for inputs sent to the LLM

## 5. API Security

### Why It's Needed
The LLM client communicates with external APIs which could be vulnerable to interception or unauthorized access.

### Implementation Approach

1. **API Authentication**
   - Implement proper API key management
   - Add request signing for API calls
   - Consider OAuth 2.0 for services that support it

2. **Secure Communication**
   - Enforce HTTPS for all external API calls
   - Implement certificate validation
   - Add connection timeouts and circuit breakers

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement client-side rate limiting
   - Add exponential backoff for retries

## 6. Application Hardening

### Why It's Needed
Additional security measures can protect against various attack vectors and unauthorized access.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Dependency Security**
   - Implement regular dependency scanning
   - Set up automatic security updates
   - Create a dependency approval process

2. **File System Security**
   - Implement path validation for all file operations
   - Use secure temporary files with proper permissions
   - Add file integrity checking

3. **Configuration Security**
   - Move sensitive configuration to environment variables
   - Implement secure defaults
   - Add configuration validation

## Implementation Priority

1. **Critical Priority**
   - User data encryption
   - Basic password authentication
   - Input validation for user commands

2. **High Priority**
   - Conversation log encryption
   - API security enhancements
   - Sensitive data filtering in logs

3. **Medium Priority**
   - Application hardening
   - Advanced authentication features
   - Dependency security

## Technical Requirements

- **Libraries**: cryptography, bcrypt, argon2-cffi, pyjwt
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for keys and secrets
- **Development**: Security-focused code reviews, static analysis tools
- **Testing**: Security test cases, penetration testing

## Compatibility Considerations

- Ensure encrypted data can be migrated and accessed across different versions
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Create secure data migration utilities for upgrades
